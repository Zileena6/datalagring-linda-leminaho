# EduCraft

A system for an educational company that offers vocational courses.
Manage courses, course instances, participants, course registrations, and store this information in a relational database.
The system should consist of three parts: a database, a backend API, and a frontend.

### Structure 
according to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture,
including at least Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and Tests.

#### The Presentation layer 
_is responsible for the API and any frontend._

#### The Application layer 
_contains application logic and use cases._

#### The Domain layer 
_contains the domain model and business rules._

#### The Infrastructure layer 
_handles database connections, Entity Framework Core, raw SQL, and other technical implementations._

#### The Tests project 
_should contain tests for the application._
